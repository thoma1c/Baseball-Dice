there once was a man in the beaches,

There once was a teen from Toronto,
who wanted to travel. Plans? Sforzando. 

He was ready to leave, so he rolled up his sleeves, 
and travelled the world almost pronto. 

When he came back, with stickers on his sack,
Learning in Windsor was a bliss. 

"Could this get any better?!" Said the reformed jetsetter, 
but then he met a certain Meliss. 

Today he is forty, and with inlaws engagingly wordy,
He laughs at the words that he read, 

He's thankful in kind, and with a smiling mind,
He sais "Nice lymeric, thanks Ed!"

It's a beautful day, in every way, and a wonderful place to be in.

When the post guy knocks, hands you a box and says "I believe it is saffron an gin."
