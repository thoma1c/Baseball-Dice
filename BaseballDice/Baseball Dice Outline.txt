1. Establish teams

	home team
	visiting team - goes first
	TODO - venue?

2. handle roll / at bat

	while outs == < 3:
		calculate persons on bases
		calculate runs
		calculate outs
		if outs == 3, next frame, (next team)

	TODO - fights? 1:30, what's the consequence?
	TODO - steals? 1:20, as a player option, advances ALL runners

	TODO - "During this break in the action..."

	TODO - Godzilla? random player eaten off field

	TODO - Only on 'strike out,' 1:35, umpire misread the count, batter advances

	TODO - Ten cent beer night - 1:75, Every roll is a home run until a sacrifice fly

	TODO - streaker. 1:50, No impact on game, but that fucker gets tazed. 

3. Handle game

	-regular game is 18 frames / nine innings (two frames per inning)
	-3 outs per frame

	-Things get tricky in the ninth:

	while playBall == True:

		if frame == 17 (top of ninth) AND outs = 3:
			if home Team Score > visiting team score
			Game over. Home team wins, playBall = false

			else:
				if home Team score <= visiting team score
				frame == 18

		if frame == 18 (bottom of ninth) :
			if home Team Score > visiting Team Score (at any time, handle walk-off):
				Win for the home Team - playBall = false

			(EXTRA INNINGS) elif outs == 3 AND home Team Score == visiting Team Score:
				frame = 19
